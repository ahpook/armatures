ARM-XX: TITLE OF ARM
====================

This text is adapted from [JEP-2](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/2)
and is intended as writing prompts for ARM proposals. Any of the
sections not flagged as REQUIRED is optional.

Summary
-------

REQUIRED -- Provide a one-paragraph summary of the proposal, no more
than a few sentences.  This summary will be rolled up into feature
lists and other documents, so please take the time to make it short
and sweet.

Problems and People
-------------------

Why should this work be done?  What are the problems it is attempting
to address and who experiences those problems? (Is it every Puppet
installation in the world? Only ones which operate under particular
conditions? Only people attempting to extend Puppet?)

Goals
-----

What are the goals of this proposal?  Omit this section if you have
nothing to say beyond what's already in the summary.

Non-Goals
---------

Describe any goals you wish to identify specifically as being out of
scope for this proposal.


Proposal
--------

REQUIRED -- Describe the enhancement in detail: Both what it is and,
to the extent understood, how you intend to implement it.  Summarize,
at a high level, all of the interfaces you expect to modify or extend,
including APIs, command-line switches, network protocols,
and file formats.  Explain how failures in applications using this
enhancement will be diagnosed, both during development and in
production.  Describe any open design issues.

This section will evolve over time as the work progresses, ultimately
becoming the authoritative high-level description of the end result.
Include hyperlinks to additional documents as required.

Prior Art
---------
Are there existing implementations either in the Puppet ecosystem or
more broadly in the domain this is attempting to address which we should
consider, learn from, or possibly adopt wholesale?

Alternatives
------------
Are there other approaches that we should consider?
